        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I really enjoy math and computer science related classes. I've always been intrigued with subjects like that, and hope to keep exploring the world of computer science. I have one sister, and of course both my parents. So, it is just the four of us. My sister's name is Amber, and she is 7 years older than I am. My major is computer science and I currently don't minor in anything but plan on enrolling in a minor later. </p>
